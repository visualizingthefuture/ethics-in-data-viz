## How to teach this course

We provide two starting points for teaching Ethics in Data Visualization:

### 1. A single, self-contained instructor slideshow 

This slideshow includes everything you'll need to lead the workshop. In addition to learner-facing slides, there are also hidden instructor slides, speaker notes, etc.


### 2. Directories with extra materials

We've included a variety of materials to make in-person instruction easier, and also to help you excerpt some of the activities and ideas here for use in another course. These include:
* Printable activity guides
* Extra resources for online instruction


## The goals for this workshop

By the end of this sessions, learners will be able to:

* List the five steps in the data visualization creation process: select topic, problem, or question; acquire data; clean data; analyze data; create the visualization
* Understand how decisions in the steps up to data visualization can affect the final visualization 
* Identify common sources of bias in the data visualization process
* Practice ethics-centered data visualization design

## Proposed timeline

* **Lecture:** 15-20 min lecturing, including individual/small group reflection questions
* **1st Activity:** [Mapping Census (ACS) Data](activities/Mapping%20Census%20(ACS)%20Data): 10-20 min full group, 15-30 min small group
* **2nd Activity:** [Redesigning Economist Charts](activities/Redesigning%20Economist%20Charts): 15-30 full group, 30-50 min small group

## Setup for online instruction
Create an online shareable document(s) or forum(s) for small group activities with links to the content or content embedded so groups can keep track of their discussions and have easy access to the images of the charts

## Setup for in-person instruction
Print out enough copies of the charts for each small group for each activity.
