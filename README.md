# Ethics in Data Visualization workshop

## Introduction
This workshop (undergrad and grad level) provides an introduction to ethics in data visualization. Please feel free to use this workshop, repurpose and remix this content, add suggestions to this project, etc.!

This project was made possible in part by the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/), RE-73-18-0059-18.

## How to teach this course

We provide two starting points for teaching Ethics in Data Visualization:

### 1. A single, self-contained instructor slideshow 

This slideshow includes everything you'll need to lead the workshop. In addition to learner-facing slides, there are also hidden instructor slides, speaker notes, etc.


### 2. Directories with extra materials

We've included a variety of materials to make in-person instruction easier, and also to help you excerpt some of the activities and ideas here for use in another course. These include:
* Printable activity guides
* Extra resources for online instruction


## The goals for this workshop

By the end of this sessions, learners will be able to:

* List the five steps in the data visualization creation process: select topic, problem, or question; acquire data; clean data; analyze data; create the visualization
* Understand how decisions in the steps up to data visualization can affect the final visualization 
* Identify common sources of bias in the data visualization process
* Practice ethics-centered data visualization design

## Proposed timeline

* **Lecture:** 15-20 min lecturing, including individual/small group reflection questions
* **1st Activity:** Mapping Census (ACS) Data: 10-20 min full group, 15-30 min small group
* **2nd Activity:** Redesigning Economist Charts: 15-30 full group, 30-50 min small group

## Setup for online instruction
Create an online shareable document(s) or forum(s) for small group activities with links to the content or content embedded so groups can keep track of their discussions and have easy access to the images of the charts

## Setup for in-person instruction
Print out enough copies of the charts for each small group for each activity.

## Activity: Mapping Census (ACS) Data
This activity looks at the impact of intersectionality and intersecting identities when mapping demographic data. The example are maps of Mississippi counties using Ameican Community Survey (ACS) data to map the percentage of people per county with income below poverty. The first set of maps compares men and women where no stark differences are seen but when race and gender are both taken into account, in the 4 maps of the second set, the dual impact of race and gender is illustrated.

### Running the activity as a whole class
Go through the slides as a class and use the questions as discussion prompts.

### Running as a small group activity 
* Split class into groups of 5-6 people
* Each group receives the same 2 maps showing Income Below Poverty by County in Mississippi. 
* Each group is given one of the following questions (only one question per group):
    * What conclusions would you draw about any effect of gender on poverty levels in Mississippi?
    * Are there any misleading components of the maps?
    * Is there any information that is missing that would be necessary for interpreting these maps?
* Share each groupâ€™s question and their response and discuss all together then show the remaining slides and discuss the questions for those slides

## Activity: Redesigning Economist Charts

### Running the activity as a whole class
Choose one or more examples to work through as a class using the quetions as discussion guides. 

### Running as a small group activity
* Split class into small groups (2-4 people)
* Give each group a copy of an original chart or the link to the original chart
* Ask each group to answer the following questions
    * What message is the chart trying to get across?
    * What is misleading about this chart or preventing this message from getting across?
    * With the above questions in mind, how would you redesign the chart? Sketch our or use your preferred visualization software to redesign the chart.
* Ask each group to share their redesign and show the better versions from the article
    * Discuss the misleading and confusing elements and if the group found something different than the article, it's a great chance to talk about differences in perspectives and the many ways to visualize the same data
    * If demonstrating a particular software, you could also demonstrate how to adjust scale and colors 

### Teaching tips for Redesigning Economist Charts
* Depending on the experience level of the students, it may be beneficial to demonstrate or work through one of the examples as a class first
* In some of the charts, it is more difficult to pick out what is misleading so they have been rated as easy, medium, and difficult in the instructor notes so choose the ones that would best fit your group or use the difficult chart as a bonus chart for groups to try if they have time
* With a large class, many groups can be working on the same chart
