## How to teach this course

We provide two starting points for teaching Ethics in Data Visualization:"

### 1. A single, self-contained instructor slideshow 

This slideshow includes everything you'll need to lead the workshop. In addition to learner-facing slides, there are also hidden instructor slides, speaker notes, etc.


### 2. Directories with extra materials

We've included a variety of materials to make in-person instruction easier, and also to help you excerpt some of the activities and ideas here for use in another course. These include:
* Printable activity guides
* Other things!!


## The goals for this workshop

By the end of this sessions, learners will be able to:

* List the five steps in the data visualization creation process: select topic, problem, or question; acquire data; clean data; analyze data; create the visualization
* Understand how decisions in the steps up to data visualization can affect the final visualization 
* Identify common sources of bias in the data visualization process
* Practice ethics-centered data visualization design
